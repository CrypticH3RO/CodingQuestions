# How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?

def find_num(array, num):
    '''
    (list, int) -> int
    Returns the index of the first occurence in the array of the given number. Returns NONE if nothing is in the array
    '''
    # Loop until reached end of the list or found number
    found = False
    i = 0
    ret = None
    while(i<len(array) and not found):
        # Check if this index is the number we're looking for
        if(array[i] == num):
            # Found the number, set flag
            found = True
        else:
            # Did not find number so increment counter
            i += 1
    # Check if the number was found
    if(found):
        # Number was found so store index of where it was found
        ret = i
    return ret
